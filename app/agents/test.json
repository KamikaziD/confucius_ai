    '{"response": "### UNDERSTAND  \\nThe user requests a compliance '
    "assessment for Coastal Hire's social media advertisement using South "
    'African advertising regulations. The ad text promotes construction '
    'equipment services with hashtags, and the query emphasizes applying the '
    'provided vector search results (from South African compliance '
    'documents).  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### ANALYZE  \\n**Key elements from the user '
    'query:**  \\n- **Ad content**: \\"Whether you\\u2019re a small contractor '
    'or managing a large-scale build, Coastal Hire has the right equipment for '
    'your needs. From scaffolding and mixers to generators and power tools, '
    'we\\u2019re the team behind your success on site. #CoastalHire '
    '#ConstructionHire #BuildWithConfidence #PowerYourProject\\"  \\n- '
    '**Context**: Social media post (implied by hashtags), targeting '
    'construction industry.  \\n- **Compliance framework**: Based on South '
    'African regulations (per vector search results).  \\n\\n**Critical '
    'factors from vector search results:**  \\n1. **Paid Disclosure '
    'Requirement** (from *Preliminary Advertisement Compliance Risk '
    'Procedure*):  \\n   - Must use labels like \\"Advertisement,\\" '
    '\\"Sponsored,\\" or \\"Ad\\" in social posts.  \\n   - *Failure = Deduct '
    '10 points*.  \\n2. **ECTA 2002 Compliance** (from *Chambers_Advertising '
    'and Marketing 2024_017_south_africa.pdf*):  \\n   - All electronic '
    'communications (including social media ads) must comply with this Act.  '
    '\\n3. **Regulated Sectors** (from *Preliminary Advertisement Compliance '
    'Risk Procedure*):  \\n   - Construction is a \\"regulated sector\\" '
    'requiring special scrutiny.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### REASON  \\n#### Step 1: '
    'Paid Disclosure Check  \\n- The ad **lacks any disclosure labels** (e.g., '
    '\\"Advertisement,\\" \\"Sponsored,\\" or \\"Ad\\").  \\n- The vector '
    'search explicitly states:  \\n  > *\\"Does the content clearly use labels '
    "like 'Advertisement,' 'Sponsored,' or 'Ad' (even in space-constrained "
    'social posts)? \\u2610 Yes (Pass) \\u2610 No (Deduct 10)\\"*  \\n- '
    '**Conclusion**: This is a **clear failure** under South African '
    'advertising standards (deduct 10 points).  \\n\\n#### Step 2: ECTA 2002 '
    'Compliance  \\n- The ad is an electronic communication (social media), so '
    'it must comply with the *Electronic Communications and Transactions Act '
    '(ECTA) 2002*.  \\n- While the vector search confirms ECTA applies, it '
    '**does not specify additional requirements** for construction ads. '
    'However, ECTA mandates:  \\n  - Clear, non-deceptive communication.  \\n  '
    '- Proper disclosure of commercial intent.  \\n- The ad\\u2019s vague '
    'phrasing (\\"has the right equipment\\") could be misleading, but **no '
    'explicit ECTA violations are identified** in the provided sources.  '
    '\\n\\n#### Step 3: Regulated Sector Considerations  \\n- Construction is '
    'a \\"regulated sector\\" (per vector search: *Phase 3: Vulnerable '
    'Audiences & Regulated Sectors*).  \\n- The ad **does not reference '
    'pricing** (\\"Up to\\"/\\"From\\" claims) or \\"New\\" claims (which '
    'would trigger deductions under the checklist), so these points are **not '
    'applicable**.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### SYNTHESIZE  \\nThe ad fails **one '
    'critical compliance requirement**:  \\n- **Paid Disclosure Failure**: '
    'Absence of labels like \\"Advertisement\\" or \\"Sponsored\\" violates '
    'South African standards (deduct 10 points).  \\n- **ECTA 2002**: While '
    'the ad must comply, the sources do not indicate specific breaches.  \\n- '
    '**Regulated Sector**: No additional issues identified (e.g., no \\"New\\" '
    'claims or misleading pricing).  \\n\\nThe ad\\u2019s structure (e.g., '
    'hashtags, industry keywords) is **not inherently compliant**, but the '
    '**primary risk is the missing disclosure labels**\\u2014a common issue in '
    'social media ads.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### CONCUDE  \\n**Compliance Status: '
    'Partial Failure**  \\n- **Critical Issue**: The ad **lacks required '
    'disclosure labels** (deduct 10 points under the *Preliminary '
    'Advertisement Compliance Risk Procedure*).  \\n- **Recommendations**:  '
    '\\n  1. **Add a disclosure label** (e.g., \\"Advertisement\\" or '
    '\\"Sponsored\\") in the post.  \\n  2. Ensure all social media ads comply '
    'with ECTA 2002 (e.g., avoid vague claims like \\"right equipment\\").  '
    '\\n  3. Consult the *South African Advertising Standards Council* for '
    'construction-specific guidelines.  \\n- **Why this matters**: In South '
    'Africa, failing to disclose sponsored content can result in regulatory '
    'penalties (e.g., fines or reputational damage).  \\n\\n> **Final Note**: '
    'While the ad is otherwise well-structured, the **absence of disclosure '
    'labels** makes it non-compliant under current South African advertising '
    'law. Addressing this is urgent to avoid penalties.", "vector_results": '
